Why front end frameworks?
- main reason is to keep UI and data in sync with each other
- helps create a consistent way of structuring code for big projects
- alleviates messy vanilla JS code for bigget scaled projects

React is: 
component-based - components are the building blocks of UI in React. all the components together make up complex UIs (like legos)
declarative - 
  - means we are telling React what a component should look like based on current data/state
  - describe how components look like and how they work using declaritive syntax called JSX
    - JSX combines HTML, CSS and JS and can also reference other React components
  - React is abstraction away from the DOM. The DOM is untouched in React
state-driven - 
  - React reacts to state changes by rerendering the UI. (thats why its called React)
JS library - React is a JS library. Still has some missing parts (routing, data fetching, server side rendering) that React frameworks like NEXT.js or Remix can help with
