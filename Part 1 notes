Why front end frameworks?
- main reason is to keep UI and data in sync with each other
- helps create a consistent way of structuring code for big projects
- alleviates messy vanilla JS code for bigger scaled projects

React is: 
component-based - components are the building blocks of UI in React. all the components together make up complex UIs (like legos)
declarative - 
  - means we are telling React what a component should look like based on current data/state
  - describe how components look like and how they work using declaritive syntax called JSX
    - JSX combines HTML, CSS and JS and can also reference other React components
  - React is abstraction away from the DOM. The DOM is untouched in React
state-driven - 
  - React reacts to state changes by rerendering the UI. (thats why its called React)
JS library - React is a JS library. Still has some missing parts (routing, data fetching, server side rendering) that React frameworks like NEXT.js or Remix can help with

React must be injected into the root of the index.html file to be rendered.
- usually injected to a div with an id of root
- js file must be named index.js because webpack looks for this specific file
- fucntion App() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)

Components:
- React applications are entirely made out of components
- building blocks of user interfaces in React
- Piece of UI that has its own data, logic, and appearance (how it works and looks)
- We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them
- Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between them

Components are written as functions
- must start with an uppercase letter
- must return markup (JSX)
- can only return one markup element. (nesting helps here)
- do not declare components inside another. Components should be declared on their own on the top level

JSX:
- Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work
- Components must return a block of JSX
- Extension of JS that allows us to embed JS, CSS and React Components into HTML
- browsers do not understand JSX. Therefore, Babel is used to convert the JSX to plain JS and HTML
- Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement() function call
- We could use React without JSX, but thats not a good practice
- works like HTML but we can enter "JS mode" by using {} (for text or attributes)
- can use JS expressions inside {}
  Ex: reference variables, create arrays/objects, [].map(), ternary operator
- JS statements are not allowed
- JSX produces JS expressions
- a piece of JSX can only have one root element. if more are needed, use React.Fragment (<>)


Imperative vs Declarative
- Imperative code tells the program how to do things
  - Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing 
  - step by step DOM mutation until we reach the desired UI (query selectors, adding event listeners, etc)
- Declarative code tells the program what we want
  - Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
  - React is an abstraction away from the DOM. We never touch the DOM
  - Instead, we think of the UI as a reflection on the current data

Styling:
- multiple ways of styling in React:
  - inline styling (not great)
    - use style attribute in JSX element
    Ex: <h1 style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "48px", textTransform: "uppercase" }}>Fast React Pizza Co.</h1>
  - external css file (import "./index.css)
    - when applying classes, React requires 'className' instead of 'class'
  - styled components

Props:
- way to pass data from parent components to child components. (cant be used vise versa)
- when accessing props, props must be passed in as an argument to the function that created the component
- anything can be passed as props: single values, arrays, objects, functions, and other components
  - if something other than a string is needed, it must be wrapped in curly braces
    - price={10}
- essential tool to configure and customize components (like function parameters)
- with props, parent components control how child components look and work
- props are read only. (immutable)
- if you need to mutate props, use state
  - mutating props would affect parent causing side effects
  - components have to be pure functions in terms of props and state
  - this allows react to optimize apps, avoid bugs and make apps predictable
- One way data flow:
  - data can be passed from parent to child, but cannot be passed from child to parent
  - this makes apps more predictable and easier to understand
  - makes apps easier to debug, since we have more control over the data
  - more performant

- props is data coming from the outside and can only be updated by the parent component
- state is internal data that can be updated by the components logic
